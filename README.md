# CS Projects

A collection of Python projects demonstrating data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Projects

### Linked List Implementation
A recursive implementation of the List ADT built from scratch. All core operations—add, remove, insert, reverse, contains, and conversion to a Python list—are handled recursively with separate helper methods for clean separation of concerns.

**Concepts:** Linked lists, recursion, encapsulation, Node-based data structures

**File:** `LinkedList.py`

---

### Row Puzzle Solver
A recursive backtracking algorithm that determines whether a puzzle is solvable. A token starts at index 0 and must reach the final index by jumping left or right based on the value at its current position. The solver explores all possible paths while using cycle detection to avoid infinite loops.

**Concepts:** Recursion, backtracking, depth-first search, cycle detection, immutable state management

**File:** `row_puzzle.py`

---

### Library Management System
An object-oriented library simulator supporting multiple media types (books, albums, movies) with different checkout periods. Features include patron management, hold requests, item tracking, and automated late fee calculation.

**Concepts:** OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, state management

**File:** `Library.py`
